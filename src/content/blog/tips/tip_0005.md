JavaScript has several built-in data types that allow you to work with different kinds of values. These data types can be categorized into two main groups: primitive data types and reference data types.

---

Primitive Data Types:

<b>String</b>: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
Example:
```javascript
  const name = 'John'  // using single quotes
  const lastName = "Smith" // using double quotes
```
<b>Number</b>: Represents numeric values, with or without decimals.
Example:
```javascript
  const x = 3; // without decimal
  const y = 3.6; // with decimal
```
<b>BigInt</b>: Used for large integers exceeding the limits of the Number data type. Denoted by appending "n" to an integer literal.
Example:
```javascript
  const bigInteger = 234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```
<b>Boolean</b>: Represents logical values true or false, commonly used for conditional testing.
Example:
```javascript
  const a = 2;
  const b = 3;
  const c = 2;
  (a == b); // returns false
  (a == c); // returns true
```
<b>Undefined</b>: Represents an uninitialized or absent value.
Example:
```javascript
  let x; // value of x is undefined
  const y = undefined; // setting variable value as undefined
```
<b>Null</b>: Represents a deliberate absence of value.
Example:
```javascript
  const z = null;
```
<b>Symbol</b>: Introduced in ES6, represents a unique and anonymous value.
Example:
```javascript
  var symbol1 = Symbol('symbol');
```

You can check variable type by using <b>typeof</b> with primitive types:
```javascript
  typeof "John Doe"; // Returns "string"
  typeof 3.14; // Returns "number"
  typeof true; // Returns "boolean"
  typeof 234567890123456789012345678901234567890n; // Returns "bigint"
  typeof undefined; // Returns "undefined"
  typeof null; // Returns "object" (known JavaScript kind of bug)
  typeof Symbol('symbol'); // Returns "symbol"
```

---

<b>Non-primitive Types</b>:

Primitive data types can hold single values. For complex and multiple values, non-primitive data types are used.
Example:
```javascript
// Collection of data in key-value pairs
var obj1 = {
   x: 43,
   y: "Hello world!",
   z: function() {
      return this.x;
   }
}

// Collection of data as an ordered list
var array1 = [5, "Hello", true, 4.1];
```
It's important to note that any data type which isn't a primitive type is considered an Object type in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, non-primitive types are also known as reference types. They are more complex data structures that can hold multiple values and have various methods and properties. Here is a list of non-primitive or reference data types in JavaScript:

<b>Object</b>: The most general type, used to store collections of data as key-value pairs.
Examples: {}, new Object()

<b>Array</b>: Used to store ordered lists of values.
Examples: [], new Array()

<b>Function</b>: A block of code that can be invoked or called.
Examples: function() {}

<b>Date</b>: Represents dates and times.
Examples: new Date()

<b>RegExp</b>: Represents regular expressions for pattern matching.
Examples: /pattern/

<b>Map</b>: Stores collections of key-value pairs with unique keys.
Examples: new Map()

<b>Set</b>: Stores collections of unique values.
Examples: new Set()

<b>WeakMap</b>: Similar to Map, but with weaker object references.
Examples: new WeakMap()

<b>WeakSet</b>: Similar to Set, but with weaker object references.
Examples: new WeakSet()

<b>Promise</b>: Represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
Examples: new Promise()

<b>Symbol</b>: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.
Examples: Symbol()

<b>Generator</b>: A special type of function that can be paused and resumed, often used for asynchronous programming.
Examples: function*() {}

<b>Proxy</b>: Allows you to create a proxy object that intercepts operations performed on an underlying target object.
Examples: new Proxy()

<b>TypedArray</b>: An array-like view on binary data buffers with a specified data type.
Examples: new Int32Array(), new Float64Array()

<b>DataView</b>: A low-level interface to read and write raw binary data in a buffer.
Examples: new DataView()

<b>Iterable</b>: An object that implements the iterable protocol, allowing it to be iterated over using for...of loops or other iterable mechanisms.
Examples: Arrays, Maps, Sets

<b>Iterator</b>: An object that implements the iterator protocol, providing a way to access values in a sequence one at a time.
Examples: Returned by the Symbol.iterator method of iterables

These non-primitive types are powerful and versatile, allowing you to work with more complex data structures and behaviors in JavaScript.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The data type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. Additionally, JavaScript has type coercion, which allows values to be converted implicitly between different types in certain operations.

Keep in mind that JavaScript's handling of types and data can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, so it's important to understand the nuances of how data types work in the language.
