<b>npm (Node Package Manager):</b>

npm stands for "Node Package Manager." It is a command-line tool and a package manager for Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. npm is used to manage and distribute open-source JavaScript packages and libraries, making it easier for developers to share and reuse code.

npm provides a vast ecosystem of packages that can be easily installed, updated, and managed within your projects. It also allows you to manage project dependencies, handle versioning, and manage scripts for various tasks, such as running tests, building your application, and more.

Some common npm commands include:

<b>npm install:</b>

- Installs dependencies specified in the package.json file.

<b>npm install package-name: </b>

- Installs a specific package.

<b>npm uninstall package-name: </b>

- Uninstalls a package.

<b>npm update package-name:</b>

- Updates a package.

<b>npm init:</b>

- Initializes a new package.json file for your project.

<b>npm run script-name:</b>

- Executes a script defined in the scripts section of package.json

node_modules Folder:

The node_modules folder is a directory created by npm within your project's root directory. It contains all the third-party packages and libraries that your project depends on. When you install packages using npm, they are downloaded and stored in the node_modules folder.

The node_modules folder plays a crucial role in managing project dependencies. It allows you to keep your project's codebase clean and focused, as you don't need to include all the package code directly within your project directory. Instead, you can simply reference the installed packages in your code.

For example, if your project uses a library like React, you can include it in your code like this:

```JSX
import React from 'react';
```

The import statement references the React library installed in the node_modules folder, making it available for use in your project.

The node_modules folder should not be manually modified or version-controlled. Instead, you typically include a package.json file in your project that lists the dependencies your project needs. When another developer wants to work on your project, they can run npm install, and npm will read the package.json file and install all the required dependencies into the node_modules folder.

In summary, npm is a package manager that helps you manage and distribute JavaScript packages, and the node_modules folder is where these packages are stored within your project's directory. This separation of dependencies keeps your project organized and maintainable while enabling you to easily incorporate external libraries and tools.
