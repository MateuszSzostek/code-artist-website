I suppose, You're familiar with using addEventListener for event-driven user experiences in modern JavaScript. If you've used events before, you know that preventDefault() and stopPropagation() are common for event handling. But did you know there's also a defaultPrevented property on events?

---

Take a look at this block of code:

```javascript
// Specific to a link
const link = document.querySelector("#my-link");
link.addEventListener("click", (e) => e.preventDefault());

// A larger document scope
document.addEventListener("click", documentClickHandler);
function documentClickHandler(event) {
  if (event.defaultPrevented) {
    // Using the property
    // Do one thing if the click has been handled
  } else {
    // Otherwise do something fresh
  }
}
```

Calling preventDefault on an event toggles the defaultPrevented property to true, which is carried by the event through event propagation. I've been working with events for many years and only recently discovered this property. The best part of defaultPrevented is that it's tied to the event, eliminating the need for global tracking.
