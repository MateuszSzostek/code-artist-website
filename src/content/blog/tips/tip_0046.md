Event bubbling is a phenomenon in the DOM (Document Object Model) where an event that is triggered on a nested element "bubbles up" through its parent elements in the hierarchy, invoking their corresponding event handlers. This means that when an event occurs on an inner element, such as a button inside a div, the event will also trigger the event handlers of the parent elements containing the inner element.

For example, if you have the following HTML structure:

```jsx
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click me</button>
</div>
```

And you have event handlers set up for both the parent and child elements:

```jsx
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Parent clicked");
});

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Child clicked");
});
```

When you click the "Click me" button, both event handlers will be triggered: first the child's event handler, and then the parent's event handler. This is event bubbling in action.

To prevent event bubbling and stop an event from propagating to its parent elements, you can use the event.stopPropagation() method within the event handler of the inner element. This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree. For example:

```jsx
document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  console.log("Child clicked");
  event.stopPropagation();
  // Prevent event bubbling
});
```

It's important to note that while preventing event bubbling can be useful in some scenarios, you should use it cautiously. Stopping event propagation may lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully, especially in cases where other elements or components rely on the event propagation to function correctly.
