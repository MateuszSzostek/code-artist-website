<b>Symbols</b> are a unique and relatively new data type introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that represent a primitive value used as an identifier for object properties. They are often used as keys for object properties to avoid naming collisions and create private properties. Here's everything you need to know about symbols in JavaScript:

<b>Creating Symbols:</b>
You can create a symbol using the Symbol() constructor or by using the Symbol.for() method. Each call to Symbol() creates a new and unique symbol, while Symbol.for() searches for an existing symbol with the given key and creates a new one only if not found.
```javascript
  const mySymbol = Symbol();
  const anotherSymbol = Symbol('description'); // Optional description
  const globalSymbol = Symbol.for('globalSymbolKey');
```

<b>Using Symbols as Object Keys:</b>
Symbols are often used as unique property keys to prevent accidental property name collisions in objects.
```javascript
  const obj = {};
  const mySymbol = Symbol('myProperty');
  obj[mySymbol] = 'This is a symbol property';
```

<b>Accessing Symbol Properties:</b>
To access properties with symbol keys, you must use the square bracket notation.
```javascript
  console.log(obj[mySymbol]); // Outputs: 'This is a symbol property'
```

<b>Symbol Iteration:</b>
Symbols are not included in standard object property iteration, ensuring that they remain private.

<b>Global Symbol Registry:</b>
The global symbol registry, accessed using Symbol.for(), allows you to share symbols across different parts of your application.
```javascript
  const globalSymbol = Symbol.for('globalSymbolKey');
  const sameGlobalSymbol = Symbol.for('globalSymbolKey');
  console.log(globalSymbol === sameGlobalSymbol); // Outputs: true
```

<b>Well-Known Symbols:</b>
ES6 introduced a set of well-known symbols that provide hooks into JavaScript's internal behavior. These symbols enable customization of default behaviors, such as iteration, type conversion, and more.
Examples:
  - <b>Symbol.iterator</b>: Specifies the default iterator for an object.
  - <b>Symbol.toStringTag</b>: Customizes the toString() behavior of an object.
  - <b>Symbol.species</b>: Specifies a constructor function used to create derived objects.
<b>Symbol Properties are Non-Enumerable:</b>
Symbol properties are non-enumerable, which means they won't appear in <b>for...in</b> loops or when using <b>Object.keys()</b>.

<b>Use Cases:</b>
- Creating private members in objects.
- Avoiding naming collisions in object properties.
- Customizing object behavior using well-known symbols.
- Creating unique constants.

<b>Caveats:</b>
- Symbols are not meant to be used as human-readable identifiers.
- They are not directly convertible to strings (except when used with Symbol.keyFor() for globally registered symbols).
- Symbols are not supported in pre-ES6 environments.

In summary, symbols are a powerful tool for creating unique and private properties in JavaScript objects, enhancing the ability to create well-encapsulated and modular code.
