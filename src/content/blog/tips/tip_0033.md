Yes, it is possible to use JSX without React. While JSX is most commonly associated with React and is often used in React applications to describe the user interface components, JSX itself is not tied exclusively to React.

JSX is essentially a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It gets transpiled into regular JavaScript code that can create and manipulate DOM elements. Therefore, you can use JSX with other libraries or frameworks, or even without any framework at all.

For example, you could use JSX with:

<b>Babel Standalone: </b>

- You can use Babel as a standalone tool to transpile JSX into JavaScript, even if you're not using React. This can be useful if you want to experiment with JSX in a simple web page without setting up a full React project.

<b>Custom JavaScript Frameworks: </b>

- If you're building your own JavaScript framework or library, you could adopt JSX as a way to describe and create components within your framework.

<b>Virtual DOM Libraries: </b>

- Some libraries offer a Virtual DOM implementation similar to React's, allowing you to use JSX for creating and manipulating elements in a more efficient manner.

Here's a simple example of using JSX without React:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JSX Without React</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/babel">
      // JSX code
      const element = <h1>Hello, JSX without React!</h1>;
      // Transpile JSX using Babel (ensure Babel is included)
      const transpiledCode = Babel.transform(element, {
        presets: ["env"],
      }).code;
      // Append the transpiled code to the app div
      document.getElementById("app").innerHTML = transpiledCode;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the JSX code is transpiled using Babel's standalone library and then inserted into the DOM. This demonstrates how JSX can be used independently of React to enhance the readability and expressiveness of your code.

However, keep in mind that JSX was originally introduced as part of the React ecosystem, and using JSX without React might lack some of the benefits and optimizations that React provides, such as the Virtual DOM and component lifecycle management.
