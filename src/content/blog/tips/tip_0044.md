In JavaScript, call, apply, and bind are three methods available on function objects that allow you to control how a function is invoked and set the value of this within the function. While all three methods serve a similar purpose, they differ in how they are used and how they pass arguments to the function. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

<b>call Method:</b>

- The call method is used to invoke a function with a specified value for this and any number of additional arguments passed individually (comma-separated).

```jsx
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! I am ${this.job}.`);
}

const person = { job: "developer" };

greet.call(person, "Alice");

// Output: Hello, Alice! I am developer.
```

<b>apply Method:</b>

- The apply method is similar to call, but it takes arguments as an array or an array-like object. It allows you to pass a value for this and an array of arguments.

```jsx
function introduce(name, age) {
  console.log(
    `My name is ${name}, I am ${age} years old. I am a ${this.role}.`
  );
}

const employee = { role: "software engineer" };

introduce.apply(employee, ["Bob", 30]);

// Output: My name is Bob, I am 30 years old. I am a software engineer.
```

<b>bind Method:</b>

- The bind method returns a new function with a specific value for this, which can be invoked later. It is often used to create a new function with pre-specified arguments and this value.

```jsx
function calculate(a, b) {
  return a + b + this.value;
}

const calculator = { value: 10 };
const boundFunction = calculate.bind(calculator, 5);

console.log(boundFunction(3));
// Output: 18 (5 + 3 + 10)
```

In summary:

- Use call when you want to invoke a function with a specific this value and provide arguments individually.
- Use apply when you want to invoke a function with a specific this value and provide arguments as an array or array-like object.
- Use bind when you want to create a new function with a specific this value and possibly some preset arguments.

All three methods are useful for controlling function invocation and managing the value of this in different scenarios. The choice between them depends on how you want to pass arguments and whether you want to immediately invoke the function or create a new function for later use.
